# Accenture-Forage-Project
## In the Accenture Social Buzz Project, the team harnessed the power of Excel for meticulous data cleaning, ensuring the information was meticulously prepared for analysis. Leveraging Tableau, they then transformed this refined data into dynamic visualizations, offering a comprehensive and insightful narrative of Accenture's online engagement and brand resonance across diverse social media platforms. This collaborative use of Excel and Tableau not only streamlined the data analysis process but also facilitated compelling storytelling, allowing stakeholders to grasp the nuances of Accenture's digital presence with clarity and precision.
